# This is a template file for providing WiFi credentials. Follow the below instructions, then rename this file to
# "wifi.txt", and store it on the SD card.
# 
# Please fill in your WiFi credentials below. 
# 
# Any line that starts with a '#' is a comment, and will be ignored by the fox. You can make changes below, but make 
# sure to leave the comment hashtags where appropriate. 
# 
# After changing the WiFi credentials, re-insert the SD card and reset the fox using the black button next to the USB socket. 

# SSID is the name of the network. 
# For example, if the network name was "My WiFi is better than yours", you would use: 
# ssid=My WiFi is better than yours
ssid=My WiFi is better than yours

# Password. Does what you think it does.
